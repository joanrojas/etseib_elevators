# etseib_elevators

For optimisation&simulation class. It consists of an algorithm I designed together with a classmate to simulate 
the elevator system at my university. 

# 1. Brief files description

*_cua.py_* is stores the queue formed at the lowest floor. 
*_ascensor.py_* manages the itinierary of the elevator. For instance, it updates the route when a person comes in and also when the person goes off.
*_persona.py_* describes the entry of the system. A group of N people comes in, each of which wishes to go to floor K, where both N and K are uniformly distributed.
