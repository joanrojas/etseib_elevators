# etseib_elevators

For optimisation&simulation class. It consists of an algorithm I designed together with a classmate to simulate 
the elevator system at my university. 

##Brief files description

#cua.py is stores the queue formed at the lowest floor. 
#ascensor.py manages the itinierary of the elevator. For instance, it updates the route when a person comes in and also
when the person goes off.
#persona.py describes the entry of the system. A group of N people comes in, each of which wishes to go to floor K,
where both N and K are uniformly distributed.
